Graphing COVID-related mortality vs. hospital-bed using pandas.  
It involves using COVID database organized by state (https://www.communitybenefitinsight.org/api/get_hospitals.php)
Also, we created hospital_bed_count that lists hospitals in each state (by county).
We created a dictionary with state_county that was used to sum across entries on hospital_bed_count.

The graph below shows no correlation between hospital beds and COVID-related mortality.
